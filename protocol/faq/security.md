### Is the Sablier protocol safe?

The security of the Sablier protocol is our outmost priority. Our team, accompanied by external auditors and consultants, has invested considerable effort to create a protocol that is safe and reliable. All contract code is publicly verifiable in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core).

### Is the Sablier protocol transparent?

As transparent as it can be. Verify the smart contracts by yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core/) and [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/labelcloud/sablier).

### Does the Sablier protocol have an administrator?

No. The contracts do not have any owner or administrator. They are as trustless as the smart contract blockchain they are deployed on.
