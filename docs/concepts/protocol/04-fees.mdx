There are three types of fees in Sablier V2: protocol fees, broker fees, and flash loan fees.

## Protocol Fees

Sablier V2 features a protocol fee that the [protocol admin](/docs/concepts/04-admin.md) can enable for specific ERC-20
assets.

This fee is charged as a percentage of the streamed amount (not a flat rate), and it applies globally to all streams
created with a particular ERC-20 asset, regardless of the stream creation method â€” be it through the Sablier Interface
or a third-party front-end application integrating the Sablier Protocol.

The admin has the ability to modify the protocol fee for individual ERC-20 assets; however, no fee may exceed the
hard-coded limit of 10%.

:::note

The protocol fee is currently set to 0% for all ERC-20 assets.

## Broker Fees

In the Sablier ecosystem, a "broker" refers to any third-party entity that interacts with the Sablier Protocol on behalf
of other users. These brokers have the ability to charge service fees for facilitating such interactions.

Broker fees are particularly useful for front-end applications that integrate the Sablier Protocol. They enable
front-end operators to levy a fee on each Sablier stream created through their platform.

Just like with protocol fees, the broker fee is a percentage of the total amount streamed, and it cannot be higher than
10%.

:::note

The official [Sablier Interface](https://app.sablier.com) does not charge any broker fees.

## Flash Loan Fees

A detailed explanation of flash loans can be found [here](/docs/concepts/protocol/06-flash-loans.md).

The flash loan fee is charged as a percentage of the principal, and is globally applied to all flash loans involving any
ERC-20 asset.

:::note

The flash loan fee is currently set to 0.05%
