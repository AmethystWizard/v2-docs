title: "Linear Streams"
---

Linear streams are the simplest form of streams one could think of: **a straight line, up and to the right.**

If you were to plot them on a graph, you would see a straight line to the right corresponding to the $f(x) = x$ function if you know your math.

With linear streams, the same fraction of the total amount being streamed is streamed over to the recipient every second. In other words, **the payment rate never changes**. This allows for greater predictability and is also very easy to understand because of how intuitive it is. Just picture a straight diagonal line going up towards the right, that's how simple it is.

Now to make things more spicy, we added a variant of the old school linear stream: **linear cliff streams**. The only difference with the traditional linear stream, is that the linear cliff streams begins with a cliff, obviously. This means nothing will be streamed in the beginning, then suddenly a specific amount if streamed over to the recipient, and from there the stream works just like a traditional linear stream.

This is a great fit if you are looking to vest tokens, as it allows you to, for example, have a 1-year cliff, and then 3 years of linear streaming. If the stream is meant for an employee, you can set it as cancellable so that if the employee leaves your company during the stream, you can stop it at any time by cancelling it.
