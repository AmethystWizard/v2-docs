There are countless use cases for the groundbreaking technology which token streaming is: payroll, vesting, airdrops, subscriptions, options, etc.

In this article, we will cover the three primary reasons people are using Sablier at the moment: payroll, vesting and airdrops.

## Payroll and Token-Vesting
For payroll and token-vesting, Sablier solves the following problems.

### 1. Traditional Payroll/Vesting Solutions Require a Lot of Manual Input
Payments need to be made manually over a long period of time, **requiring ongoing efforts from the treasury management team**. Every month, the head of treasury will have to initiate a significant series of payments to compensate contributors, handle vesting for employees and investors.

This is **time intensive**, is **prone to errors**, and **offers a bad user experience for both parties**. The organization needs to spend all that time handling the administration, making the payments etc… while the recipients have to wait for a month, quarter or sometimes even longer to receive their compensation.

**Conversely, Sablier streams only have to be set up once**. You just have to provide the total duration of the stream (can be a month, a year, or even multiple years) and that's it - **there's no further action needed from you again, ever**.

Recipients receive their compensation gradually over time: every second they receive a fraction of the funds. **This fits great for both parties**. The organization only needs to spend time once, to set up all the streams. On the other hand, the recipients receive the funds gradually over time, allowing them to manage their finances as they wish.

### 2. Release Schedules Imply a Schelling Point for Speculators
> In game theory, [a focal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory) (also called Schelling point) is a solution that people tend to choose by default in the absence of communication.

Since traditional vesting contracts have a predictable release schedule, the day on which a vesting period ends may be used as a Schelling point for speculators.

Certain recipients may intend on dumping their tokens as soon as they receive them. With Sablier streams, recipients receive a fraction of the total payment every second and can thus withdraw a portion of funds at any time - in effect, **this solves the dumping problem**.

### 3. Discrete Payments Lack Transparency
It's hard to aggregate discrete payments, which is why they typically lack transparency. It's hard to figure out from looking at an old transaction on Etherscan to whom it was made, whether or not it was for payroll or vesting tokens… As a DAO, it's especially important for your contributors to be able to see where the money is going and why.

These problems don't happen with Sablier as when the tokens are streamed, **anyone can check the Sablier interface to monitor the status of a stream and all transactions associated to it**.

[**Here is an example of a stream**](https://app.sablier.com/stream/pro-5-36/). As you can see, the interface provides a stream link which can be shared to the public to visualize the stream, an Etherscan link is also provided if you are looking to check the transaction status.

**Sablier's interface also provides a complete transaction history**, so that anyone can see when withdrawals were made, and what amounts were withdrawn from the streamed funds by the recipient.

In short: **transparency is native to Sablier**.

## Airdrops
**Unless you have a very specific reason not to, you should be using Sablier to airdrop your new token to your community.**

### Traditional Airdrops Are Flawed
Airdrops have become a routine in the crypto industry. Over the years it has become the standard way of launching a new token and for good reasons: it's a great way to give ownership of a project to the right people.

However, **the traditional way of doing airdrops is flawed**. The vast majority of airdrop receivers only claim the tokens to dump them on the market afterwards, and the interest these airdrops gather is short-lived.

The real major problem, though, is that **traditional airdrops don't create the right incentives for community members**. They don't incentivize long-term thinking, for example, as community members generally get all the airdropped tokens at once instead of over time. This is a major problem because community members are the backbone of a crypto project, and losing the majority of them immediately after the airdrop isn't great.

The solution to this problem is extremely elegant and creates the right incentives for community members to think on a long-term perspective. It will guarantee that community members keep the project's future as their first and foremost priority. That solution is called token streams.

### Using Token Streams to Airdrop Your Token

Instead of airdropping the entirety of the tokens all at once, airdrop recipients receive a fraction of the tokens every second through a token stream.

**A token stream can have a duration of a few days, weeks, months and even years**. You could, for example, vest the airdrop of your new token over 4 years. Or 6 months. You get to choose. The beauty of it is that airdrop recipients are forced to think long-term and keep the project's future as their first and foremost priority. They are forced to, because instead of receiving all the tokens at once, they receive them over time.

**Token streams not only create the right incentives, but also ensure that the price of your token won't crash on day one**. This has been the case for many airdrops, where a large percentage of the airdrop recipients dumped immediately after claiming their tokens.

With token streams, airdrop recipients only receive a fraction of the tokens every second, and have to manually claim the tokens which have already been streamed.

Using Sablier, **token streams can be linear** where the recipients receive the same amount every second, **exponential** where the recipients receive exponentially more over time, etc.

### Token Streams > Every Other Airdrop Solution
Token streams provide a much better way to stream tokens than do traditional airdrops. The former gets community members to be aligned with the project's interests and think on a long-term perspective, the latter doesn't.

If you are launching a new token, use token streams.
