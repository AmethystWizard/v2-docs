## Protocol, Interface, Labs

To start with, it would help to clarify the differences between the various components of "Sablier", some of which may
confuse new users.

- **The Sablier Protocol**: A collection of persistent, non-upgradeable smart contracts that together create a protocol
  which facilitates streaming of ERC-20 assets on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains.
- **The Sablier Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Sablier protocol. The interface
  is only one of many ways to interact with the Sablier protocol.
- **Sablier Labs**: the company that developed the Sablier protocol, the user interfaces associated with it, and the
  documentation website you are reading now.
