The Sablier protocol enables **streams of ERC-20 tokens in a decentralized manner** across various blockchain networks
like Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism. The protocol's primary goal is to prioritize **security and resistance to
censorship** while avoiding intermediaries that could restrict access.

**The Sablier protocol consists of a series of immutable smart contracts**. Currently, there are three verions of the
protocol, V1.0 and V1.1, which are available under the GNU General Public License v3.0, and V2.0 which is licensed under
BUSL-1.1. All three are [open-source](https://github.com/sablierhq).

Once deployed, each version of Sablier operates in perpetuity as long as the underlying blockchain remains active,
ensuring uninterrupted service. The Sablier protocol is immutable, which means that its code is unchangeable. **It
cannot be paused, contracts cannot be altered, and the creation of streams cannot be reversed by any party**. Anyone can
create a stream, **there are no restrictions regarding the use of the protocol**, which contrasts with traditional
finance services where services are only offered to specific groups of people based on age, wealth, nationality, etc.
