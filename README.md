Contributing to the Sablier docs is a great way to get involved in the dev community and help other people along the way.


## Installation

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Local Development

```bash
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Updating the Technical Reference

To update the technical reference with the latest changes made to the contracts, execute the following command at the root of the repository:
```bash
